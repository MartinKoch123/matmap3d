function [az, el, slantRange] = ecef2aer(x, y, z, lat0, lon0, alt0, spheroid, angleUnit)
%% ecef2aer  convert ECEF of target to azimuth, elevation, slant range from observer
%
%%% Inputs
% * x,y,z: Earth Centered Earth Fixed (ECEF) coordinates of test point (meters)
% * lat0, lon0, alt0: ellipsoid geodetic coordinates of observer/reference (degrees, degrees, meters)
% * spheroid: referenceEllipsoid parameter struct
% * angleUnit: string for angular units. Default 'd': degrees
%
%%% Outputs
% * az, el, slantrange: look angles and distance to point under test (degrees, degrees, meters)
% * az: azimuth clockwise from local north
% * el: elevation angle above local horizon
